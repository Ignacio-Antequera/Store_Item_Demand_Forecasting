## Project Reflection

The project presented several challenges, including handling seasonality in the data, choosing appropriate models, and addressing deprecation warnings in XGBoost. The decision to move away from complex neural network models like LSTM, based on observed seasonality, and opting for XGBoost showcases the importance of adapting the modeling approach to the data characteristics.

**Challenges:**
- Seasonality in the data required careful exploration and influenced the choice of models.
- Deprecation warnings in XGBoost required attention and informed decisions about model implementation.

**Tools Used:**
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation.
- XGBoost for gradient boosting.

**Approach:**
- Thorough data exploration and preprocessing to understand and handle seasonality.
- Feature engineering to create relevant datetime-related features.
- Model selection and tuning, with a focus on XGBoost and consideration of alternative models.
- Ensembling techniques were explored for improved accuracy.

**Techniques:**
- Rolling averages for trend analysis.
- Time series cross-validation for model evaluation.
- XGBoost for gradient boosting and ensemble methods.
